## Introduction
KcpSharpN is a C# implementation translated from [the original KCP project](https://github.com/skywind3000/kcp)<br/>
## What is KCP
KCP is a high-performance, reliable transport protocol designed to significantly reduce latency compared to traditional TCP.<br/>
According to the original arthur of KCP protocol, comparing to TCP, it can achieve a 30¡V40% reduction in average latency and up to three times lower maximum delay, costing 10¡V20% additional bandwidth overhead.<br/><br/>
